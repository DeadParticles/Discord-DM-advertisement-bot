# Discord-DM-advertisement-bot

This requires the Discord.js module as it is written in nodejs. The script is pretty much easy to use, make sure you have at least basic knowledge of nodejs before using it.

Current features:

1. It can DM all members using a time limit
2. Has the ability to ignore users to DM.
3. You can put any message you want.
4. The bot can split long messages, which makes the job easier to use long advertisement messages.
